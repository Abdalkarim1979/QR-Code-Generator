### Explanation

1. **DOCTYPE Declaration**:
   - The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used.

2. **HTML Tag**:
   - The `<html>` tag is the root element of the HTML document. It includes the `xmlns` attribute to specify the XML namespace and `lang` attributes for language settings.

3. **Head Section**:
   - The `<head>` section contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, character set, and viewport settings.
   - It also includes links to external JavaScript files (`jquery.min.js` and `qrcode.js`).

4. **CSS Styling**:
   - The `<style>` tag contains CSS to style the page, including the body, headings, input fields, and the QR code container.

5. **Body Section**:
   - The `<body>` section contains the main content of the page.
   - It includes a heading (`<h1>`), an input field (`<input>`) for entering text, and a `<div>` to display the generated QR code.

6. **JavaScript**:
   - The JavaScript code initializes a new QRCode object and assigns it to the `qrcode` variable.
   - The `makeCode` function generates a QR code based on the value entered in the input field.
   - Event listeners are added to the input field to generate the QR code when the input loses focus (`blur` event) or when the Enter key is pressed (`keydown` event).

This code creates a simple web page that allows users to generate a QR code from the text they enter. The QR code is displayed in the `#qrcode` div element.
